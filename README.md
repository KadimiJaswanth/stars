# Star Field Background

This project creates a mesmerizing star field effect using Three.js, a 3D JavaScript library. It generates a dynamic background of stars that appear to move towards the viewer, creating the illusion of traveling through space.

## Features

- **Realistic star field**: The stars are randomly placed in 3D space and are animated to give a feeling of depth and motion.
- **Responsive design**: The animation automatically adjusts to fit any screen size.
- **Interactive**: The scene adapts to window resizing.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the page and including the necessary scripts.
- **CSS**: Provides the basic styling to make the star field occupy the full viewport and have a black background.
- **JavaScript (Three.js)**: Creates the 3D scene, camera, and animation logic for the star field.

## How It Works

1. **HTML**: The HTML file sets up the basic structure, including a div element to hold the background animation.
2. **CSS**: The CSS ensures the background container (`#bg-container`) takes up the full screen, removing margins and paddings, and sets a black background.
3. **JavaScript (Three.js)**: The JavaScript file handles the creation of the 3D scene using Three.js:
   - It initializes the camera and scene.
   - Creates a large number of particles representing stars, with random positions and sizes.
   - Animates the stars to move towards the camera, giving the illusion of flying through space.
   - Resizes the canvas when the window is resized.

## Installation

To use this project, simply follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the star field in action.

No server setup is required; it's a simple front-end project.
